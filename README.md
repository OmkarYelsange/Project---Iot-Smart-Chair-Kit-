> **Revolutionizing comfort, health, and productivity through IoT and smart sensing.**  

---

## 📖 Introduction  
The **IoT-Enabled Smart Chair Kit** is an innovative solution designed to enhance **ergonomics, posture monitoring, and health awareness** in modern workplaces, educational institutions, and even car seats.  
Built with **ESP32, Arduino, multiple sensors, and IoT integration (Blynk Dashboard)**, the chair ensures smarter sitting habits by tracking **sitting time, posture, weight distribution, vibration levels, and ambient conditions**.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives & Motivation  
- Encourage **healthy sitting habits**.  
- Provide **real-time data monitoring** via **IoT dashboard**.  
- Improve **workplace ergonomics & health awareness**.  
- Bridge the gap between **traditional seating & smart monitoring** systems.  

---

## ⚙️ Key Features  

✅ **Smart Sitting Time Tracker** – Monitors duration of sitting sessions.  
✅ **Posture Detection** – Flex & force sensors identify incorrect posture.  
✅ **Load Monitoring** – Multiple load cells detect proper weight distribution.  
✅ **Health Alerts** – Buzzer/vibration feedback for long sitting or poor posture.  
✅ **Environmental Monitoring** – Temperature sensor for room conditions.  
✅ **IoT Dashboard (Blynk)** – Real-time data visualization on mobile/PC.  
✅ **Compact Kit Design** – Electronics neatly integrated behind the backrest & under the seat.
